# Instant Reward App

Developed to mimic the leveling system of Solo Leveling Manhwa to motivate myself to do something benefit.

## How This App Works

- Unlike the leveling system in Solo Leveling Manhwa, we don't have any indicators that truly describe our growth. Therefore, money is the easiest by far.
- Of course the money doesn't reflect directly to the size of our real wallet. It serves as a believe system that we could earn that much if we keep doing something that benefits us.
- In addition, a fake EXP system is used to measure our growth. This could be true since we could become more skillful in things that we prioritize by keep doing it, such as writing your own code, reading books, going for gym session.
- If you do things that make you feel bad, there's where the deducting amount is used.
- The amount for increasing and decreasing the amount of money and EXP depends on how you feel at that point of time when doing the task. If the task feels too struggle for you and you did it, feel free to add more points to yourself. If the task feels too evil for and you did it, be honest and deduct more.
- No point in cheating. Just be honest to yourself when using it.
